Visualizes Grails Service and Controller Dependencies using Graphviz

Simple tool I wrote one afternoon to visualize complex Grails apps I was working with. See [my blog post](http://ilikeorangutans.github.io/2014/05/03/using-golang-and-graphviz-to-visualize-complex-grails-applications/) about the topic. 

To Do
-----

This is app is a huge hack and currently can even produce invalid Graphviz files. It's by no means perfect, but allowed me to generate the beautiful graphs reference below:
